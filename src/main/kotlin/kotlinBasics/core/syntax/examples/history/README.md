# ðŸ‘‹ Example: Hello, Kotlin!

Welcome to your first Kotlin program!

This example shows the **simplest possible structure** of a Kotlin app.  
It teaches you:

- What the `main()` function looks like
- How to use `println()` to display output
- That Kotlin doesn't require a class to start

## ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters

Unlike Java, Kotlin lets you write top-level functions.  
This keeps your code clean and simple from the start.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
}
```

âœ… **Try this:**
- Change the printed text
- Add more `println()` lines
- Remove the `fun main()` â€” what happens?

Youâ€™ll be doing much more soon, but every journey starts with a first line of code.
