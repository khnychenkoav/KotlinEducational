# 📦 Examples: Comments in Kotlin

This example shows the three types of comments supported by Kotlin:

| Type         | Syntax           | Use Case                            |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Single-line  | `//`             | Quick notes and inline explanations |
| Multi-line   | `/* ... */`      | Longer explanations or temp blocks  |
| KDoc         | `/** ... */`     | API documentation with structure    |

---

## 💡 Try This!

- Add a new function and document it with `/** ... */`
- Use comments to explain “why”, not just “what”
- Temporarily disable one function call with a multi-line block

---
Remember: Good comments explain *intent*, not just *code*.
