# ✍️ Exercise: Print and Format Text

## 🎯 Your Mission

Write a small Kotlin program that:

1. Declares three variables:
    - Your name (`String`)
    - Your age (`Int`)
    - Your favorite quote (`String`)
2. Uses `println()` and **string interpolation** to output an introduction.
3. Displays your quote using escape characters (`\"`).

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge

Try the following:

- Print a small table with `\t` (tabs) for alignment.
- Use a **multiline string** (`"""`) to display a welcome message with your name.

---

## ✅ What You’re Practicing

- `println()` and `print()`
- String interpolation and expressions
- Escape sequences and formatting
- Multiline strings and alignment

---

## 💡 Tips

- Use `"\t"` to separate columns.
- Use `"""` and `trimMargin()` or `trimIndent()` for cleaner multi-line output.
- Think about **readability** — format output like it’s meant for real users!

---

🔁 Once you're done — play around:
- Change the values
- Add more data to your table
- Try using expressions inside `${}`

Let your creativity print itself!
