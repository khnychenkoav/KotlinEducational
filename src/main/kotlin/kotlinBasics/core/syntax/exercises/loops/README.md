# ✍️ Exercises: Practice Loops

## 🎯 Your Mission

Write simple Kotlin programs to solidify your understanding of loops.

### Tasks:

1. **Count down from 10 to 1** using a `for` loop with `downTo`
2. **Print only even numbers** between 1 and 20 using `continue`
3. **Ask the user to enter a password** until they enter `"kotlin"` (use `do..while`)
4. **Create a table of squares** from 1 to 10 using a loop
5. **Use `repeat()`** to print a message 5 times
6. **Bonus**: Create a multiplication table from 1 to 5 using nested loops
