# ✍️ Exercise: Practice Writing Comments

## 🎯 Your Mission

Improve the given Kotlin file by adding **clear, meaningful comments**.

### Your tasks:

1. Add at least one `//` single-line comment
2. Add a `/* ... */` block comment
3. Document at least one function using `/** ... */` (KDoc)
4. Comment out one line of code in `main()` (simulate debugging)
5. Write *useful* comments that explain *why* the code is written, not just what it does

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Comments help:

- Future-you (and others) understand complex logic
- Improve communication in team projects
- Document code in a way IDEs and tools can understand

---

## 💡 Tips

- Don’t comment the obvious
- Avoid generic notes like `// function`
- Prefer explaining *why* a choice was made

---

## 🧪 Bonus Challenge

- Add a new function and write full KDoc for it
- Try using a nested multi-line comment for disabling a code block inside another comment

---

Once you're done — run the program and try different inputs to check yourself!
