# ✍️ Exercise: Main Function & Structure

## 🎯 Your Mission

Create a simple Kotlin program that:

1. Declares a top-level variable `developer` with your name
2. Defines a top-level function `introduce()` that prints a message using that variable
3. Calls that function inside `main()`

---

## 📌 Bonus Challenge

Add another function `printArgs(args: Array<String>)` that prints arguments passed to the program, and call it from `main(args)`.

---

## ✅ What You're Practicing

- Entry-point structure: `main()`
- Kotlin-style variable and function declarations
- Package declarations and file layout
- Parameterized functions and `Array<String>`

---

👨‍🔬 Once done, test it by changing the `developer` value or adding another helper function.
