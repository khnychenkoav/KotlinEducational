# ✍️ Exercise: Print Your Name & Favorite Language

## 🎯 Task

Update the provided program to:

- Print your **real name**
- Print your **favorite programming language**

Try to use **variables** and **string interpolation** (`$variableName`) to build the message.

## 👇 Starter Template

```kotlin
val name = "Your Name"
val favoriteLanguage = "Kotlin"
println("Hello, my name is $name.")
println("My favorite programming language is $favoriteLanguage.")
```

## 💡 Why It Matters

This task gets you writing real code:  
You’ll practice variables, string handling, and `println()` — the core building blocks of any Kotlin program.

## 🧠 Bonus Challenge

Add a third line explaining *why* you like that language.  
Can you do it all in one line using multi-line strings or string templates?
