# 🧩 LeetCode Practice in Kotlin

Welcome to the **LeetCode solutions module** of the Kotlin Educational repository!

This section contains selected algorithmic challenges solved in idiomatic Kotlin — with clarity, performance, and readability in mind.

> Each solution aims to be self-contained, well-commented, and optimized for both learning and real-world readiness.

---

## ✅ What’s Included

- 📘 **Clean and readable Kotlin code**
- 🧠 **Algorithmic insight** and edge case handling
- 💬 **Problem descriptions and examples** directly in code comments

---

## 📂 Structure

Each problem has its own folder, named with a descriptive title and the LeetCode problem number:

```
leetCode/
├── divideArrayIntoEqualPairs2206/
│   └── Solution.kt
├── findKthBitInNthBinaryString1545/
│   └── Solution.kt
├── longestNiceSubarray2401/
│   └── Solution.kt
├── minimumCostWalkInWeightedGraph3108/
│   └── Solution.kt
```

Inside each folder:
- `Solution.kt` contains the full solution
- Top-of-file block comments summarize the problem
- Kotlin idioms are used where appropriate

---

## 🛠 How to Use

- Browse problems to find topics you’re studying (e.g. binary search, recursion, bitwise ops)
- Run each file individually from your IDE or terminal
- Try improving the solution or writing tests
- Fork and expand with your own solutions!

---

## 📈 Goals

This LeetCode section is not just about getting the “Accepted” status — it's about:

- Writing **production-quality Kotlin**
- Practicing **problem-solving patterns**
- Improving **code clarity under constraints**

More problems will be added regularly — both easy warmups and hardcore challenges.
