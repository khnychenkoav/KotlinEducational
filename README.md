## Introduction

Learning to program is a journey filled with challenges and rewards. **Kotlin Educational** is designed with beginners and intermediate developers in mind. Our mission is to provide clear examples, detailed explanations, and practical exercises to help you master Kotlin and essential programming concepts.

This repository features:
- **Algorithm Challenges:** Explore solutions to problems from LeetCode and other sources.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Dive into implementations of arrays, stacks, binary trees, tries (prefix trees), and more.
- **Theoretical Guides:** Access curated articles, tutorials, and documentation to deepen your understanding.
- **Practical Examples:** See how theory is applied in real projects with hands-on code examples.
